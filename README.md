# "Bring Dislikes Back" campaign

This repo is made to fight YouTube removing dislikes. This happened a long time ago, and most of the people didn't like this decision. 

# How does this work?

Grab the JavaScript code right [here](https://gist.github.com/ArxifyByte/f2dd40c8827974509390c04fc2fb5eee).<br>

Head over to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com) and log in with your YouTube channel's email address. <br>

Create a new project.<br><br>

Head over to the Services tab in the left-hand menu and add the "YouTube Data API v3" service.<br><br>

Remove all of the current code on the script and paste the JavaScript code that you grabbed earlier. (if you didn't, press [here](https://gist.github.com/ArxifyByte/f2dd40c8827974509390c04fc2fb5eee))<br>

Grab your YouTube video link, remove the `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=` part and save the part of the URL that you have now for later.<br>

Edit the "videoID" variable with the video ID that you got on the previous step.<br><br>
